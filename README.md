# Overview

# About ENS

ENS is a decentralised naming service built on top of Ethereum, and designed to resolve a wide array of resources including blockchain addresses, decentralised content, and user profile information.

Developer documentation can be found [here](https://docs.ens.domains/).

Information on existing ENS deployments can be found [here](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-deployments).

# Additional Context

We implement userspace versions of SHA1 and SECP256p1. SHA1 is required for some DNSSEC zones; we don't choose the hash, the zone owner does. SECP256p1 is likewise used in many zones, including those hosted by cloudflare. 

The offchain DNS resolver uses [EIP 3668](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668) (CCIP-Read) and [ENSIP-10](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-10-wildcard-resolution) to support gasless DNS-based name resolution.

Slither does not work on this repository; we've reached out to the team in the past and nobody seems sure why not. If you find a workaround, please share it in the Discord.
