regarding slither not working on the repo, it doesn't work if you just do `slither .` but you can run it on individual subfolders in `contracts/` without issue
e.g.:
`slither ./contracts/dnsregistrar --solc-remaps "@ensdomains/=./node_modules/@ensdomains/ @openzeppelin/=./node_modules/@openzeppelin/"`
`slither ./contracts/dnssec-oracle --solc-remaps @ensdomains/=./node_modules/@ensdomains/`

Hey, the `Scoping Details` on the github page indicates:
```- How many contracts are in scope?:   21
- Total SLoC for these contracts?:  2103```

But there are 18 contracts in scope with 2022 SLOC (from the Scope section)

Are there any contracts missing? @kartoonjoy  @Jeff Lau @nickjohnson


[04/14/2023 21:56] bitspinner
Minimal Slither patch:

filename: `crytic_compile/platform/hardhat.py`
```bash
# find local file
find / -name "hardhat.py" -path "*crytic_compile/platform*" 2>/dev/null
```

In file, find/replace:

find
```
source_unit.ast = info["ast"]
```

replace with
```
try:
  source_unit.ast = info["ast"]
except:
  source_unit.ast = info["legacyAST"]
```

Seems to be a problem with crytic-compile when dealing with DummyOldResolver using compiler v. 0.4.11

@Jeff Lau @nickjohnson Please may I ask, to understand not because I think its an issue. Why does the `resolve` function in  OffchainDNSResolver.sol Revert with callback details, I understand that it gets the callback, but how does that mechanism work? (or just point me to in the right direction to research) Please?

[04/20/2023 13:41] csjaybit
yeah just started learning yul


[04/20/2023 14:56] malfurionwhitehat
I recommend using chatgpt for that

```
Explain this to me

  assembly {
            ret := keccak256(add(add(self, 32), offset), len)
   }


This appears to be a snippet of code written in Assembly language for a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Specifically, it is calculating the Keccak-256 hash of a portion of the contract's memory.

Let me break down the code for you:

"assembly" indicates that the following code is written in Assembly language.
"ret" is likely a variable that will hold the resulting hash value.
"keccak256" is a hashing algorithm used in Ethereum to create a unique 256-bit hash of data.
"add" is an operation that adds two values together.
"self" is a reference to the contract's own address in memory.
"32" is an offset value indicating the number of bytes to skip over from the start of the memory block.
"offset" is likely another variable indicating the number of bytes to skip over from the start of the memory block.
"len" is likely another variable indicating the length of the memory block to be hashed.

So, in essence, this code is taking a block of memory starting at the memory address self + 32 + offset and with a length of len, and calculating the Keccak-256 hash of that block. The resulting hash value will be stored in the ret variable.
```

Congrats Frens!!!


[05/17/2023 10:34] .hangyaku
umm...I submitted 7 total gas optimisation techniques in one single report, any idea why my name isn't on the list?


[05/17/2023 16:54] hunter_w3b
I submitted 17 total gas optimization  😂   alot of them imo correct


[05/17/2023 16:55] .hangyaku
lol so why aren't we mentioned then 😢


[05/17/2023 16:55] hunter_w3b
imo because of bot 🦾


[05/17/2023 16:57] .hangyaku
but I'm sure that the bot hadn't figured out all the gas optimisation techniques


[05/17/2023 16:57] .hangyaku
this is disappointing lol


[05/17/2023 17:04] hunter_w3b

Very much looking forward to the final report. Can't wait to see what 7 Mediums have been hiding in this codebase.

Has anyone received there rewards?


[05/18/2023 15:38] t1moh
They will publish once payouts sent


[05/18/2023 16:31] angry_mustache_man
I guess they have already published it in the 'announcements' section


[05/24/2023 08:34] hunter_w3b
Any judge of this contest?


[05/25/2023 15:49] lsdan
You can DM me if you'd like to discuss particulars


[05/25/2023 17:09] hunter_w3b
Yes why not thanks


[06/08/2023 02:15] tamayonft
Sorry guys I just want to know how long is the payout


[06/09/2023 09:43] aba1842
they have been sent a long time ago https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/810929015509483554/1108477905677336576
For some reason, C4 staff does not post in the contest channels when payouts are done or when the reports are out. You need to follow announcements/the newsletter for that


[06/15/2023 12:13] sheldonholmgren
Will there be an announcement in this channel when the report goes public?


[06/15/2023 16:17] 0xagro
🙏


[07/19/2023 08:14] sheldonholmgren
Still waiting for the report 😦
